### 📄 More Details:

👨‍💻 **Backend:** My pride and passion is developing web services. Currently, I am participating in the development of a web platform for the amazing company eastclinic.ru.

🗄️ **Database:** Databases are the foundation of a reliable service. In each case, I choose the technology that has proven itself for the specific task. I don’t limit myself to one technology and always strive to choose the right database for the job, whether it’s MySQL or Clickhouse.

🌐 **Frontend:** In today’s rapidly changing internet, it’s crucial to find a reliable technology to meet business goals. For me, that technology is Vue. It’s a fantastic framework for all kinds of tasks. But if ultra-high performance is needed, I turn to Svelte.

🚀 **DevOps:** Full-stack development today undoubtedly involves deployment technologies. I am proficient in setting up a complete deployment cycle using Docker and Jenkins.
